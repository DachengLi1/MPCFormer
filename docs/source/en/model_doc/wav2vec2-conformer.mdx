# Wav2Vec2-Conformer

## Overview

The Wav2Vec2-Conformer weights were released by the Meta AI team within the [Fairseq library](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/main/examples/wav2vec/README.md#pre-trained-models).

Tips:

- Wav2Vec2-Conformer follows the same architecture as Wav2Vec2, but replaces the *Attention*-block with a *Conformer*-block
  as introduced in [Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100).
- Wav2Vec2-Conformer uses the same tokenizer and feature extractor as Wav2Vec2.
- Wav2Vec2-Conformer can use either no relative position embeddings, Transformer-XL-like position embeddings, or
  rotary position embeddings by setting the correct `config.position_embeddings_type`.

This model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten).
