# Token classification

## PyTorch version, no Trainer

Fine-tuning (m)LUKE for token classification task such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Parts-of-speech
tagging (POS) or phrase extraction (CHUNKS). You can easily
customize it to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.

It will either run on a datasets hosted on our [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or with your own text files for
training and validation, you might just need to add some tweaks in the data preprocessing.

The script can be  run in a distributed setup, on TPU and supports mixed precision by
the mean of the [ðŸ¤— `Accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) library. You can use the script normally
after installing it:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate
```

then to train English LUKE on CoNLL2003:

```bash
export TASK_NAME=ner

python run_luke_ner_no_trainer.py \
  --model_name_or_path studio-ousia/luke-base \
  --dataset_name conll2003 \
  --task_name $TASK_NAME \
  --max_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir /tmp/$TASK_NAME/
```

You can then use your usual launchers to run in it in a distributed environment, but the easiest way is to run

```bash
accelerate config
```

and reply to the questions asked. Then

```bash
accelerate test
```

that will check everything is ready for training. Finally, you can launch training with

```bash
export TASK_NAME=ner

accelerate launch run_ner_no_trainer.py \
  --model_name_or_path studio-ousia/luke-base \
  --dataset_name conll2003 \
  --task_name $TASK_NAME \
  --max_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir /tmp/$TASK_NAME/
```

This command is the same and will work for:

- a CPU-only setup
- a setup with one GPU
- a distributed training with several GPUs (single or multi node)
- a training on TPUs

Note that this library is in alpha release so your feedback is more than welcome if you encounter any problem using it.
