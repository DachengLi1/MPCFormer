# Generation

Each framework has a generate method for auto-regressive text generation implemented in their respective `GenerationMixin` class:

- PyTorch [`~generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate`] is implemented in [`~generation_utils.GenerationMixin`].
- TensorFlow [`~generation_tf_utils.TFGenerationMixin.generate`] is implemented in [`~generation_tf_utils.TFGenerationMixin`].
- Flax/JAX [`~generation_flax_utils.FlaxGenerationMixin.generate`] is implemented in [`~generation_flax_utils.FlaxGenerationMixin`].
